# Il Chiostro

Simple restaurant menu I made for a friend of mine who wanted to use QR codes instead of a plastic menu. I took the opportunity to learn a bit about React. the purpose of the site is to look good on a smartphone's screen, it looks a bit weird on a desktop pc with a big screen. You probably don't want to copy this code, shurely won't want to copy the css.
